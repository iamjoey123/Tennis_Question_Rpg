# tennis-question-rpg
Just a little project of my teammate's and mine.
But only the rpg.html belongs to me.

This is a little game combining the tennis question and little game. If you choose the wrong answer, you
will lose a heart. The main purpose is that for one, I am interested in animation of webpages, so I learn
the basic code while coding, secondly, the pictures in this game are drawn by me and it is excited to 
combine my hobbie and the works.
